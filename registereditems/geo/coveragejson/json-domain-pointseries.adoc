=== PointSeries
==== Overview
PointSeries is a coverage domain type. A PointSeries can only contain `[x,y]` positions (and not `z` or additional coordinates):

- A domain with PointSeries domain type MUST have the axes `"x"`, `"y"`, and `"t"` where `"x"` and `"y"` MUST have a single coordinate value only.
- A domain with PointSeries domain type MAY have the axis `"z"` which MUST have a single coordinate value only.

This is consistent with the GeoJSON definition of a point.

==== Source Reference
It is defined in the https://docs.ogc.org/is/19-086r5/19-086r5.html#pointseries[OGC CoverageJSON Community Standard, Section 9.10.3] which is maintained by the OGC Coverages Standard Working Group using this https://github.com/opengeospatial/CoverageJSON[OGC GitHub repository].

===== Example 1, PointSeries Domain - rectangle
A point defined by the coordinates `(1.0,20.0)`, at vertical coordinate `1`, and for the time `"2008-01-01T04:00:00Z"`

==== Media type
application/vnd.cov+json

==== Link relation types
Link relation types do not seem applicable for a PointSeries Object. Possibly `describedby` could be useful.
