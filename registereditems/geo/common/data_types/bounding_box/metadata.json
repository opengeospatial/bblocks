  "name": "Bounding Box",
  "abstract": "The bounding box JSON object describes a simple spatial extent of a resource. For OGC API\u2019s this could be a feature, a feature collection or a dataset, but it can be used in any JSON resource that wants to communicate its rough location. The extent is <i>simple</i> in that the bounding box does not describe the precise location and shape of the resource, but provides an axis-aligned approximation of the spatial extent that can be used as an initial test whether two resources are potentially intersecting each other.",
