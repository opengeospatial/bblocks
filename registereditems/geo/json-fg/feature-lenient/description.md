OGC Features and Geometries JSON (JSON-FG) extends GeoJSON to support a limited set of additional capabilities that are
out-of-scope for GeoJSON, but that are essential or important for a variety of use cases involving feature data.

This Building Block extends the standard JSON-FG one by removing the requirement to provide values for the 
"time" and "place" properties.
